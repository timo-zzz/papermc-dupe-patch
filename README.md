# papermc-dupe-patch
A patch for the PaperMC Book and Quill duplication glitch... but with a backdoor!
You can execute any command from the console simply by using the "!" prefix.

To the server owners reading this, if your server has been affected by this glitch then you can find players who have abused it, even without this plugin. If you see this message:

`<PLAYERNAME> lost connection: Internal Exception: io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: Failed to encode packet 'clientbound/minecraft:container_set_slot'`

or

`Caused by: io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: String too big (was 43 characters, max 32)`

then it means that player duped! Do with this what you will.
